# Voice Verification Toolkit
The advanced analysis of voice data, encompassing voice cloning, embedding extraction, and the use of cosine similarity for voice verification. 
It enables the differentiation between original and cloned voices, as well as the verification of speaker identity, leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.
## Overview
The toolkit comprises three main components: voice cloning using a Text-to-Speech (TTS) API, extraction of voice embeddings, and analysis of these embeddings through cosine similarity. 
This multi-faceted approach facilitates a thorough examination of voice data, providing essential tools for speaker verification and the study of voice cloning technologies.
